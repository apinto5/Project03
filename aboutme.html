      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p class="strong">Campton, New Hampshire</p>
      <p>I grew up in the town of Campton, New Hampshire, at the base of the White Mountains. The town was small — around 3,330 citizens — and managed itself through direct democracy, taking place in the form of a majority vote at the meeting hall. The town's economy ran predominantly on tourism, with the skiing industry throughout the White Mountains playing a heavy hand during the winter months. <b>More about the White Mountains:</b></p>

      <p>I grew up on Branch Brook Campground, my parents' business. On the property was Turkey Jim's Bridge, a state landmark! Slightly outdated info about Turkey Jim's Bridge from <a href="https://www.nh.gov/nhdhr/bridges/p79.html">NH.gov</a>:</p>
      <p>The original covered bridge on this site was built in 1874. The bridge's name originates from farmer, Jim Cummings, whose property it served. Cummings property was popularly known as Turkey Jim's Turkey Farm. The bridge was replaced in 1958 by Milton Graton at a cost of $3,700. It was discovered then that due to the deteriorated condition of the structure it could not be repaired but would have to be replaced. In 1964, the bridge washed downstream, was retrieved, and set back on its abutments. It is no longer open to vehicular traffic but is used as a pedestrian crossing and snowmobile crossing in the winter. Turkey Jim's Bridge was constructed in a manner which replicates the traditional style of covered bridges but has not reached the 50 year National Register of Historic Places age criteria.</p>
