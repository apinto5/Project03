        <h4>Ozymandias, by Percy Bysshe Shelley</h4>
	<div class = "poetry">
        	<p>I met a traveller from an antique land,</p>
        	<p>Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone</p>
        	<p>Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,</p>
        	<p>Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,</p>
        	<p>And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,</p>
        	<p>Tell that its sculptor well those passions read</p>
        	<p>Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,</p>
        	<p>The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;</p>
        	<p>And on the pedestal, these words appear:</p>
        	<p>'My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;</p>
        	<p>Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!'</p>
        	<p>Nothing beside remains. Round the decay</p>
        	<p>Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare</p>
        	<p>The lone and level sands stretch far away.”</p>
  </div>
  <h4>Tale of a Tub, by Sylvia Plath [Lines 1 - 8]</h4>
	<div class="poetry">
      	 	<p>The photographic chamber of the eye</p>
        	<p>records bare painted walls, while an electric light</p>
        	<p>lays the chromium nerves of plumbing raw;</p>
        	<p>such poverty assaults the ego; caught</p>
        	<p>naked in the merely actual room,</p>
        	<p>the stranger in the lavatory mirror</p>
        	<p>puts on a public grin, repeats our name</p>
        	<p>but scrupulosuly reflects the usual terror.</p>
        </div>
        <h4>Holy Sonnet X, by John Donne [Lines 1 - 5]</h4>
    <div class="poetry">
		      <p>Death, be not proud, though some have called thee</p>
          <p>mighty and dreadful, for thou are not so;</p>
        	<p>for those whom thou think'st thou dost overthrow</p>
        	<p>die not, poor Death, nor yet canst thou kill me.</p>
    </div>
